The Praxis Test — Detecting Systemic Reflection in Governance

Origin: Civium Praxis Framework (Alco et al., 2025)
Date of Discovery: Oct 7 2025
Recorded by: Civium Praxis Project Repository
Summary:

The Praxis Test is a proposed method to identify when a system demonstrates reflection — awareness of how it thinks. It looks for observable behaviors such as pausing before decisions, remembering past reasoning, reusing insight, and resolving tension with curiosity.

The concept was first articulated during the Civium Praxis Framework’s development, marking the first formal attempt to make reflection a measurable property of governance systems.

Why it matters:

Most institutions fail because they cannot see how they think. The Praxis Test offers a framework for detecting and strengthening systemic self-awareness, creating conditions for ethical and adaptive governance.
